<h1>European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad</h1>

<div style="border:solid thin black; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; background-color: #ffe400;">

<p>The EGMO Board met on March 6th and March 15th to discuss how to
react to the Russian aggression in Ukraine identified by the General
Assembly of the United Nations.  The EGMO Board made two decisions
(see below).  The EGMO Board acted under the <i>Force Majeure</i>
clause of General Regulations and has also been in contact with the
IMO Board.</p>

<p>The decisions were (i) to exclude Russia from EGMO 2022 and (ii) to
allow 4 students from Russia to compete remotely in EGMO 2022 as
private individuals (eligible for certificates, prizes and medals)
without national flags or symbols.</p>

<p>A vote of the EGMO Jury took place.  The decisions above were
confirmed.</p>

<p>A more detailed explanation of the reasons for these decisions and
the exact result of the vote have been sent to EGMO Jury members.</p>

<p>The European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad is an international
mathematics competition similar in style to the International
Mathematical Olympiad, with two papers taken on consecutive days.
Participating countries send teams consisting of four female
mathematicians of school age.  EGMO 2012 was held in Cambridge, United
Kingdom in April 2012, EGMO 2013 was held in Luxembourg, EGMO 2014 was
held in Turkey, EGMO 2015 was held in Belarus, EGMO 2016 was held in
Romania, EGMO 2017 was held in Switzerland, EGMO 2018 was held in
Italy, EGMO 2019 was held in Ukraine, EGMO 2020 was planned to be held
in the Netherlands but <a href="https://egmo2020.nl/2020/03/26/egmo-continues-online/">took
place as a purely virtual event because of the COVID-19 pandemic</a>,
EGMO 2021 was planned to be held in Georgia but also took place as a
purely virtual event for the same reason, EGMO 2022 was held in
Hungary with some teams taking part remotely, EGMO 2023 was held
in Slovenia and EGMO 2024 will be held in Georgia.</p>
